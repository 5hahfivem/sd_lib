## Credits
Special thanks to [Linden](https://github.com/thelindat) and the amazing team at [@overextended](https://github.com/overextended), who developed `ox_lib`. I've adopted their `init.lua`, particularly the module initialization method, with a few modifications of my own and their callback module, which I've stripped down and slightly altered to suit my purposes.

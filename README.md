## sd_lib
A FiveM library/resource specializing in expanding upon natives and bridging frameworks as well as common/popular resources.

Currently, this serves as a reconstructed version of my original 'library' file, previously utilized as part of my paid resources available at [https://fivem.samueldev.shop](https://fivem.samueldev.shop). The functions in this library may exhibit inconsistent styling, linting issues, and other discrepancies. While this library is fully functional, it is not yet implemented in any of my resources. I plan to release the lib officially once I am confident in its stability and performance.

## Credits
Special thanks to [Linden](https://github.com/thelindat) and the amazing team at [@overextended](https://github.com/overextended), who developed `ox_lib`. I've adopted their `init.lua`, particularly the module initialization method, with a few modifications of my own.
